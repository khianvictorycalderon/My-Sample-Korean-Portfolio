                    <span class="t3">
                        Hello! I'm Khian Victory D. Calderon, i studied basic korean language but not necessarily fluent in it.
                        I took an exam of EPS-TOPIK in DMW in Ortigas Philippines this March 25, 2024 but did not pass with the score of 95 / 200, <i>(110 is the passing score)</i> 
                        because i didn't have enough time to study, i only had 2 months to study korean at that time.
                        Even though i did not pass the exam, i still continued to study korean when i have free time ever since.
                        So i have prepared a lesson plan to share and teach for those who wants to learn korean.
